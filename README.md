This is a node backend service using express, inversify & sequelize

I failed to containerize it due to some issue with localstack but it is working locally 

You need the following to run the app

  - docker
  - docker-compose
  - postgres

set up the db info in ormConfig and if you want run migration using the sql file in the db folder or when sequelize intializes it will sync it up

Run the following:

    - docker-compose up localstack

    - npm run build
    - npm run locally synth
    - npm run locally bootstarp
    - npm run locally deploy

The above command will deploy the lambda, sqs, sns on the localstack using cdk, cdk-local

Then to run the app 

    - npm run start

Then to test the apis following can be used
